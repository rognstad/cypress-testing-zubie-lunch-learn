## What's wrong with Selenium/E2E testing now?

1. Web has evolved since 2004
    1. Async
    1. JS-driven DOM
    1. Stateful apps
1. Tough to mock
1. Awkward API
1. Slow (network)
1. Can't use WebDriver and DevTools

## What is Cypress?

> Fast, easy and reliable testing for anything that runs in a browser

Cypress is a free, open source, MIT-licensed testing tool that works in the browser exactly like dev tools

+++

## Tries to make testing fast and easy when

1. Getting started (easy installation, opinionated)
1. Writing tests (jQuery selectors, chainable methods)
1. Using and maintaining tests (fast, clear steps, clear error messages, DOM snapshots, access to app context)

It replaces Selenium, Protractor (wrapper), Mocha (test framework), Chai (assertion lib), Sinon, etc. (additional libs)
