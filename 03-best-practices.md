## Best Practices

- Test individual parts of your app at a time
- Work on a single test at a time
- Clear your state between each test
- Don't repeat a bunch of steps that you've already tested elsewhere (e.g. logging in)
- Use resilient selectors to find elements on page (e.g. add data- attributes)
